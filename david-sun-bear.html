                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>The Sun Bear (<em>Helarctos malayanus</em>) is the smallest bear species in the world and one of the most fascinating creatures of Southeast Asia's tropical rainforests. Known for their distinctive golden chest patch that resembles a rising sun, these bears are perfectly adapted to life in the dense forest canopy.</p>
                    
                    <p>Despite their small size, Sun Bears are incredibly strong and agile. They spend most of their time in trees, using their long, curved claws and flexible bodies to navigate the forest canopy with remarkable ease. Their powerful jaws and long tongues make them expert honey extractors, earning them the nickname "honey bear."</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">Habitat & Distribution</h2>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>Sun Bears are native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, including:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Malaysia and Indonesia (Borneo and Sumatra)</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>They prefer lowland tropical forests but can also be found in montane forests up to 2,000 meters elevation. These bears are highly arboreal, spending up to 50% of their time in trees.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">Diet & Behavior</h2>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>Sun Bears are omnivorous with a diverse diet that includes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Fruits:</strong> Figs, berries, and other forest fruits</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>These bears are primarily solitary and nocturnal, though they may be active during the day in undisturbed areas. They communicate through various vocalizations, including grunts, growls, and huffing sounds.</p>

                    <h3>Conservation Status: VULNERABLE</h3>
                    <p>Sun Bears face significant threats from habitat loss, poaching, and the illegal wildlife trade. Their forest homes are rapidly disappearing due to palm oil plantations, logging, and agricultural expansion.</p>
